# README

This repository contains my solutions for the ICA Data Science Candidate Take Home Task.  My analysis can be easily  viewed in the `ICA_Data_Science_Takehome_Solutions_by_John_Fee` html file, but it can be reproduced by running the corresponding `.Rmd` file.  I used the `renv` package to track dependencies, so you *should* be able to reproduce my environment using the renv.lock file if necessary.   

Let me know if you have any questions/concerns!
